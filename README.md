# Face Detection and Recognition using CNNs 
<ul>
<li>Implemented and trained InceptionResnetV1 on custom dataset to generate face embeddings for multi-class classification on Pytorch framework, attaining 96% test accuracy on custom dataset

<li>Utilized MTCNN pre-trained model for face detection

<li>Evaluated and compared performance against Siamese Network trained by reducing contrastive loss to generate discriminative features for faces
</ul>
