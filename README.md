# Face Detection and Recognition using CNNs 
<ul>
<li>Implemented and trained InceptionResnetV1 on custom dataset to generate face embeddings for multi-class classification on Pytorch framework, attaining 96% test accuracy on custom dataset

<li>Utilized One Shot Learning for training of model to generate embeddings for face images

<li>Evaluated and compared accuracy against Siamese Network trained by reducing contrastive loss to generate feature vectors for faces
</ul>
